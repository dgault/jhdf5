    <title>The HDF5 API</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> 
    HDF5 is an efficient, well-documented, non-proprietary binary data format and library developed 
    and maintained by the <a href="http://hdfgroup.org/">HDF Group</a>. CISD has created a high-level 
    API in Java for reading and writing HDF5 files, building on the libraries provided by the HDF Group.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to get started with the API, see the <a href="HDF5FactoryProvider.html">
    <code>HDF5FactoryProvider</code></a> class.
    </p>
    <p>
    For simple standard use, have a look at  
    <a href="IHDF5SimpleWriter.html"><code>IHDF5SimpleWriter</code></a> interface for read-write 
    access and the <a href="IHDF5SimpleReader.html"><code>IHDF5SimpleReader</code></a> interface for 
    read-only access.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you need to perform advanced operations, see the 
    <a href="IHDF5Writer.html"><code>IHDF5Writer</code></a> interface for read-write access and the 
    <a href="IHDF5Reader.html"><code>IHDF5Reader</code></a> interface for read-only access.

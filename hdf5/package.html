    <title>The HDF5 API</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> 
    HDF5 is an efficient, well-documented, non-proprietary binary data format and library developed 
    and maintained by the <a href="http://hdfgroup.org/">HDF Group</a>. CISD has created a high-level 
    API in Java for reading and writing HDF5 files, building on the libraries provided by the HDF Group.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to get started with the API, see the <a href="HDF5Factory.html">
    <code>HDF5Factory</code></a> class.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you need full control over the creation of the writers and readers, see the 
    <a href="HDF5Writer.html"><code>HDF5Writer</code></a> class for read-write access and the 
    <a href="HDFReader.html"><code>HDF5Reader</code></a> class for read-only access.

/**
 * An object representing the storage features that are to be used for a data set.
 * <p>
 * The <code>..._KEEP</code> variants denote that the specified storage features should only be
 * applied if a new data set has to be created. If the data set already exists, it will be kept with
 * whatever storage features it has.
 * <em>Note that this may lead to an exception if the existing data set is non-extendable and the 
 * dimensions of the new data set differ from the dimensions of the existing data set.</em>
 * <p>
 * The <code>..._DELETE</code> variants denote that the specified storage features should always be
 * applied. If the data set already exists, it will be deleted before the new data set is written.
 * This is the default behavior. However, if the
 * {@link IHDF5WriterConfigurator#keepDataSetsIfTheyExist()} setting is given, the
 * <code>..._DELETE</code> variant can be used to override this setting on a case-by-case basis.
 * <p>
 * The available storage layouts are {@link HDF5StorageLayout#COMPACT},
 * {@link HDF5StorageLayout#CONTIGUOUS} or {@link HDF5StorageLayout#CHUNKED} can be chosen. Only
 * {@link HDF5StorageLayout#CHUNKED} is extendable and can be compressed.
 * <p>
 * For generic (that is non-integer and non-float) data sets only one type of compression is
 * supported, which is <i>deflation</i>, the method used by <code>gzip</code>. The deflation level
 * can be chosen to get the right balance between speed of compression and compression ratio. Often
 * the {@link #DEFAULT_DEFLATION_LEVEL} will be the right choice.
